### <span style="color:#a43fa0"> <u>**Landing Page 📖 : ** </u></span> 

This webpage is designed to exhibit the minimal and stunning craftsmanship of our company. The heading when condensed it says COVID where C is Careers, O is Overview, V is Vantage, I is Internships and D is Design. The company was started in the year 2019. This company is an architecture, designing and crafting company with highly skilled and creative people. They offer internships a lot and has a lot of reputation.

The <mark>**theme**</mark> is blended with the background (gold and grey).

As having a huge company needs a website to represent itself out wide in the public, so this <mark>**motivated**</mark> us to create this website.

The template and highlights were chosen from the colors in the background image. Actually I planned to make a moving (dynamic backdrop), but as this being an image, I can't show that and also I am not sure whether AdobeXD or Figma is as powerful as plain html coding.

To make the website more authentic, I have also added a chatbot at the bottom right to assist the users.
