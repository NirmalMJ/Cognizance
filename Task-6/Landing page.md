# SARS Company
============

#### **Landing Page:**

This webpage is designed to exhibit the minimal and stunning craftsmanship of our company. The heading when condensed it says COVID where C is Careers, O is Overview, V is Vantage, I is Internships and D is Design. The company was started in the year 2019. This company is an architecture, designing and crafting company with highly skilled and creative people. They offer internships a lot and has a lot of reputation.

The **theme** is blended with the background (gold and grey). 

As having a huge company needs a website to represent itself out wide in the public, so this **motivated** us to create this website.

The template and highlights were chosen from the colors in the background image. Actually I planned to make a moving (dynamic backdrop), but as this being an image, I can't show that and also I am not sure whether AdobeXD or Figma is as powerful as plain html coding.

To make the website more authentic, I have also added a chatbot at the bottom right to assist the users. 

  
In the future iterations or in the successive pages, we can add a slide up images which shows our previous tasks to exhibit our talented staffs here. And the website can be dynamic and the colors can change by the mean method or the dominant method such that everyday a new image and a new color palette.

And with CSS and JS, we can make wonders like having a back to top button, smooth transitions, location, and improving the chatbot by applying internships and all using the chatbot. And improve the backend. 

Also we can create a page like creative corner and daily people can upload images of their ideas and the next day we rank the ideas and share them in social media, which makes more people to be creative and also think more about our company.
