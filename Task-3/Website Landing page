Let us assume that there exists a company in the name SARS. They have architects and does planning, constructions, designing complex and mind boggling scriptures and all.

They also give the internships to students and provides more job offer to them.

The landing page for this website.
This contains the general welcome part. And just to show that there is a feature of highlights of the current topic, I have selected the career part.
It has the navigation menu on the top right, it is in the order of C_O_V_I_D. Which are Careers, Overview, Vantage, Internships and Design
And also the company logo and the name on the top left. Some catchy line and no idea for a byline so I left that.
And learn more to explore more into that. 

And to make this screenshot look more legit and futuristic I have also included an chatbot on the bottom right.

I used figma to make this.
